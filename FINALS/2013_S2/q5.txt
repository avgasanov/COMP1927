Question 5 ... COMP1927 13s1 Final Exam

A. (CORRECT)

Operation             State of Queue after operation
                      [highest priority ... lowest priority]

initially             -
PQueueJoin(PQ, 'X')       [X]
PQueueJoin(PQ, 'A')	    [A,X]
PQueueJoin(PQ, 'J')       [A,J,X]
PQueueLeave(PQ)		   [J,X]
PQueueJoin(PQ, 'K')       [J,K,X]
PQueueLeave(PQ)           [K,X]
PQueueLeave(PQ)           [X]

B. (CORRECT)

Stacks are FILO
Queues are FIFO

Since PQueues are nearly exactly the same as Queues, except for the fact that the PQueue is re-ordered every iteration (so that the highest priority item is first to leave the PQueue), we only need to remove the ordering function / operation in the PQueue to make it a Queue.

For Stacks, they work in a FILO order, which means that the first items going in would be the last ones coming out. To imitate this in a PQueue, you must set the highest priority item as the one which most recently joined the queue.
