<h2> Sample Exam Theory Questions </h2>

<h2>Question 1</h2>

<p>
Consider the following pair of functions:
<pre>
int cmp(int a, int b)
{
    return (a-b);
}

void sort(int a[], int n)
{
    int i, j, min;

    for (i = 0; i < n-1; i++) {
        min = i;
        for (j = i+1; j < n; j++) {
            if (cmp(a[j],a[min]) < 0) min = j;
        }
        int t = a[min]; a[min] = a[i]; a[i] = t;
    }
}
</pre>

<p>

Based on the above answer the following questions:
<ol>
<li>
    How many times will the cmp() function be invoked if the sort() function is called with an array of length 6?
<li>
    How many times will the cmp() function be invoked if the sort() function is called with an array of length n?
<li>
    What is the complexity of the sort() function? (e.g. O(n), O(log n), etc.)

 </ol>

<h2>Question 2</h2>

Consider inserting the following keys into an initally empty binary search tree in the order specified: 

<pre>
15  30  35  8  25  22  3  21  10  11  
</pre>

<p>
Determine the final tree that would be constructed (you do not need to draw this tree anywhere, except as rough working in your exam booklet). Show the order that key values would be be displayed if we traversed the tree in each of the following orders: 
<ol type="a">
<li>Prefix (NLR) order
<li>Postfix (LRN) order
<li>Level Order
</ol>

<h2>Question 3</h2>

<p>
A <em>priority queue</em> is a structure where each item
has an associated value which specifies its priority for removal
from the structure.
Answer the following questions on priority queues:
</p>
<ol type="A">
<li><p>
Consider a priority queue where the items are character values, and the
priorities are determined by the alphabetical ordering of the items.
Items which have <em>lower</em> alphabetical ordering are assigned
higher priority (e.g. <tt>'A'</tt> has higher priority than <tt>'B'</tt>).
Suppose you are going to implement it in a way that results in O(log n) insertion and deletion.
Show the intermediate states of an initially-empty priority queue <tt>PQ</tt>
when the following operations are performed on the queue in the order
shown:
</p>
<pre>
PQueueJoin(PQ, 'X')
PQueueJoin(PQ, 'A')
PQueueJoin(PQ, 'K')
PQueueLeave(PQ)
PQueueJoin(PQ, 'J')
PQueueJoin(PQ, 'Z')
PQueueLeave(PQ)
PQueueLeave(PQ)
</pre>

<li>
<p>
Priority queues (PQs) can be viewed as a generalisation of structures like Stacks and FIFO Queues. Briefly describe how you might implement Stacks and Queues as PQs. In particular, specify what kind of value could be used as the priority value and how the priority values would be ordered. 
</ol>

<h2>Question 4</h2>

 Consider the following 2-3-4-tree, where the numbers repesent key values stored in the tree nodes and the upper-case letters are labels on the nodes for you to use in answering the question:
<center><img src="http://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~tarat/cs1927/samples/COMP1927%2015s1/234-treeSE.png"></center>
<ol type="A">
<li><p>
Show the contents of each of the tree nodes (A,B,C,D)
after the key value 15 is inserted into the tree.
If any new nodes are created, show their contents as well,
and identify them by E, F, G, etc.
</p></li>
</ol>
<p>
Red-black trees were devloped as an alternative representation
for 2-3-4-trees that could use (almost) standard binary search
tree nodes.
</p>
<ol type="A" start="2">
<li><p>
What is the difference between red-black tree nodes and standard
binary search tree nodes?
</p></li>
<li><p>
Does every 2-3-4-tree have a unique representation as a red-black
tree?
</p></li>
</ol>
<p>

<h2>Question 5</h2>

<p>
Consider a hash table of size 13 and a hash function:
</p>
<pre>
int hash(int k) { return (k % 13); }
</pre>
<p>
Consider inserting the following key values into an initially
empty hash table in the order specified:
</p>
<pre>
3  26  16  4  29  12  25  13  7  20
</pre>
<p>
Show the final contents of the hash table for each of the
following strategies for handling collisions:
<ol type="A">
<li><p>
Chaining
</p></li>
<li><p>
Linear probing
</p></li>
<li><p>
Double hashing, with a second hash function:
</p>
<pre>
int hash2(int k) { return (7 - (k % 7)); }
</pre></li>
</ol>
<p>

<h2>Question 6</h2>
<p>
Consider the following weighted, undirected graph:
</p>
<center><img src="http://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~tarat/cs1927/samples/COMP1927%2015s1/GraphSE.png"></center>
<p>
Answer the following questions using this graph:
</p>
<ol type="A">
<li><p>
Show the order in which vertices would be visited if we
carried out a breadth-first search
</p>
<ul>
<li> starting from vertex <tt>a</tt>
<li> visiting all vertices once
<li> selecting neighbours based on descending vertex order <br>
     (i.e. using reverse alphabetical order (<em>highest</em> to lowest))
<li> ignoring weights
<li> only adding edges to the queue when there vertex has not been visited
     and is not already in the queue
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>
Show the order in which vertices would be visited if we
carried out a breadth-first search
</p>
<ul>
<li> starting from vertex <tt>a</tt>
<li> visiting all vertices once
<li> selecting neighbours in edge-weight order <br>
     (i.e. using lowest-to-highest costs on the edges)
<li> only adding edges to the queue when there vertex has not been visited
     and is not already in the queue
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Show your working by giving the intermediate states of
the queue, "pre" and "st" arrays in both cases.
