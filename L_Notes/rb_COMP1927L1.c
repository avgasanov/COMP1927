/* LECTURE 1

// In 1927, we should adopt a systematic attitude of writing programs / dealing with problems
// Pre-conditions
	// Things that you have to satisfy before starting
	// Eg. 1927 as a function
	   -> Takes in some STUDENTS --> Prints out some STUDETS
	   If you enter this course, knowing already how to program, Richard's
	   course is to take you out to becoming a computer scientist.
// Post-conditions
	// Qualities that you can rely on
// A FUNCTION is something that goes from pre-conditions -> post-conditions

In C, when you write a function that has pre-conditons, how we deal with that?
// E.g. function to take 2 numbers and then divide it by a non-zero number
// You would write an ASSERT to deal with this (make it a pre-condition)

1917 is about what we do
// The mechanics of a program / writing a program
19127 course is about meaning

P.A.P.P - central breakdown of the course
// PROBLEM - In computing, we have problems
// ALGORITHM - We solve these problems with algorithms
// PRODUCE - We implement the algorithm and produce a program
// PROCESS - We run the algorithm and we get a process.

1917 focuses more on PROBLEMS / ALGORITHMS
// Moving from problems -> algorithms and the relationship between them

2911 is all about "given a problem, how do I come up with an appropriate algorithm"

INSERTION SORT ALGORITHM
// Start with unsorted data
// Go through unsorted data 1 element at a time
// Put it into the correct spot so far (ignoring the rest of the unsorted data)
// You pick the next thing, you make a decision where to put it into the sorted pile
then you place it there.
// You pick up the third one, you have three spots to put it. You pick a spot again
using two comparisons

SELECTION SORT
// Take the first one, then put it into the correct spot the first time
// Move to the second one, then put it into the correct spot again first time
// and so on.

BUBBLE SORT
// A series of swaps
